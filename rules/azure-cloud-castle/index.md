# Game rules

Prerequisites:

 - A OWASP Cornucopia card deck. Both Website App Edition and Ecommerce Edition can be used.
 - A dice. Any time will do.
 - A computer
 - A presentation of each of the characters, with their description, printed out with a desktop printer.


Start the game by selecting a game master to lead the game if the game master hasn't been preselected. The game master will use the "cheat sheet" to keep track of where to lead the players.

The game master deals out all the OWASP Cornucopia cards. Once that is done let each player select a character associated with "The Azure Cloud Castle" game. The characters can be found by clicking on the characters tab and selecting "Azure Cloud Castle". 

Letting the players choose their character by name only, is more fun. Don't spend time reading up on the individual characters as it will steal valuable time that could be used for playing the game. Once you have played the game a couple of times, you can also play the game infront of an audience. If so, dress up as your favorite character for the event.

Once everyone has a character, get them to present themselves. This way, everyone knows about each others abilities, skills and spells.

The game master select "Azure Cloud Castle" from the games meny and start to read the plot of the game. If you have a projector, you can open the game in two windows. Project one window to the participants in order to display the images to them and use a separate window to read the plot. Alternatively, you can tell each of the participants to follow the story on their own laptop and tell them what to do.

After reading the plot, the players are presented with 1-4 choices.
They can "cast a spell", "use a weapon", "throw the dice" or "use a card".
All options are not always available. The players are not told which option is the best. The game master keep track on whether the choices the player make are valid or not. Free yourself from the story and improvise if the players come up with interesting solutions and choices. Just make sure to lead them back to the story so that you don't diverge too far from the storyline.
